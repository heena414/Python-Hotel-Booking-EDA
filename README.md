## Business Problem

In recent years, both city hotels and resort hotels have experienced high cancellation rates, leading to significant challenges such as reduced revenue and suboptimal room occupancy. This situation demands urgent attention, as reducing cancellation rates is crucial for improving revenue generation. Our goal is to offer comprehensive business advice to tackle this issue effectively.

## Data Preparation and Cleaning
